# Architecture and Design Plan for Unified Virtual Machine Library

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for unifying the parallel computing simulation framework (`vm_emulator`) and the secure systems vulnerability simulator (`secure_vm`) into a shared library that eliminates code duplication while preserving specialized functionality.

## Analysis Summary

After comprehensive analysis of both implementations, approximately 60-70% of core functionality can be shared between the two personas:

### Common Components Identified
- **Virtual Machine Core**: Base VM lifecycle, state management, program loading
- **CPU/Processor**: Register management, instruction execution pipeline, state tracking
- **Memory System**: Basic read/write operations, address validation, access logging
- **Instruction Framework**: Instruction types, operand handling, execution dispatch
- **Execution Tracing**: Event logging, timeline generation, export formats
- **Visualization**: Timeline generation, memory heatmaps, performance charts
- **Performance Metrics**: Cycle counting, instruction throughput, bottleneck analysis
- **Utilities**: Common helpers, configuration management, data structures

### Specialized Components
- **Parallel VM (`vm_emulator`)**: Multi-threading, synchronization primitives, race condition detection, thread scheduling, memory coherence protocols
- **Security VM (`secure_vm`)**: Memory protection (DEP, ASLR, canaries), privilege levels, attack simulation, control flow integrity, forensic analysis
