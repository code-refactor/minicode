# Unified Text Editor Architecture Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture plan for creating a unified text editor library that supports both student and writer personas. The plan focuses on extracting common functionality into a shared `common` library while preserving persona-specific features and behaviors.

## Analysis Summary

### Common Functionality Identified

Both persona implementations share these core patterns:

1. **Text Buffer Management**: Both need basic text storage and manipulation
2. **File Operations**: Loading, saving, and path management
3. **Position/Cursor Management**: Tracking location within text
4. **History/Undo System**: Operation tracking and reversible actions
5. **Search and Navigation**: Pattern matching and content finding
6. **Statistics and Analytics**: Word counts, character counts, progress tracking
7. **Extensibility Framework**: Plugin/customization capabilities
8. **Background Processing**: Non-blocking operations
9. **Pydantic Data Models**: Consistent validation and serialization

### Persona-Specific Features

**Student Persona**:
- Progressive feature unlocking
- Coding interview preparation
- Spaced repetition learning
- Algorithm customization playground
- Educational scaffolding

**Writer Persona**:
- Focus mode for distraction-free writing
- Narrative element tracking
- Advanced revision management
- Writing-specific analytics
- Non-linear document navigation

#### 2. Interface Definitions

##### Core Editor Interface
```python
class EditorInterface:
    def get_content(self) -> str
    def insert_text(self, position: Position, text: str) -> None
    def delete_text(self, start: Position, end: Position) -> str
    def get_cursor_position(self) -> Position
    def move_cursor(self, direction: Direction, count: int = 1) -> None
    def find_text(self, pattern: str) -> List[Match]
    def replace_text(self, pattern: str, replacement: str) -> int
    def undo(self) -> bool
    def redo(self) -> bool
```

##### Document Interface
```python
class DocumentInterface:
    def save(self, path: Optional[str] = None) -> None
    def load(self, path: str) -> None
    def get_word_count(self) -> int
    def get_char_count(self) -> int
    def is_modified(self) -> bool
    def get_metadata(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

##### Statistics Interface
```python
class StatisticsInterface:
    def calculate_basic_stats(self) -> BasicStats
    def track_change(self, change: Change) -> None
    def get_progress_data(self) -> ProgressData
    def get_performance_metrics(self) -> PerformanceMetrics
```

### Shared Data Models

#### Position and Navigation
```python
class Position(BaseModel):
    line: int = Field(ge=0)
    column: int = Field(ge=0)

class Selection(BaseModel):
    start: Position
    end: Position
    
class NavigationHistory(BaseModel):
    positions: List[Position] = Field(default_factory=list)
    current_index: int = 0
```

#### Change Tracking
```python
class Change(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    type: ChangeType
    position: Position
    content: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)

class ChangeType(str, Enum):
    INSERT = "insert"
    DELETE = "delete"
    REPLACE = "replace"
```

#### Statistics Models
```python
class BasicStats(BaseModel):
    word_count: int = 0
    char_count: int = 0
    line_count: int = 0
    paragraph_count: int = 0

class ProgressData(BaseModel):
    start_time: datetime
    end_time: Optional[datetime] = None
    target_words: Optional[int] = None
    current_words: int = 0
    session_duration: timedelta = Field(default_factory=timedelta)
```

### Unified Text Buffer

The core text buffer will combine the best aspects of both implementations:

```python
class TextBuffer(BaseModel):
    lines: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    encoding: str = "utf-8"
    modified: bool = False
    
    def insert_text(self, position: Position, text: str) -> None:
        """Insert text at the specified position"""
        
    def delete_text(self, start: Position, end: Position) -> str:
        """Delete text between positions and return deleted content"""
        
    def replace_text(self, start: Position, end: Position, replacement: str) -> str:
        """Replace text between positions"""
        
    def get_text(self, start: Optional[Position] = None, end: Optional[Position] = None) -> str:
        """Get text content in the specified range"""
        
    def get_line_count(self) -> int:
        """Get total number of lines"""
        
    def get_content(self) -> str:
        """Get entire buffer content as string"""
```

### Extension Points

#### Plugin System
```python
class PluginInterface:
    def initialize(self, editor: EditorInterface) -> None:
        """Initialize plugin with editor instance"""
        
    def on_text_changed(self, change: Change) -> None:
        """Handle text change events"""
        
    def on_cursor_moved(self, old_pos: Position, new_pos: Position) -> None:
        """Handle cursor movement events"""
        
    def get_commands(self) -> List[Command]:
        """Return list of commands provided by plugin"""
```

#### Persona-Specific Extensions
```python
class PersonaExtension(PluginInterface):
    def get_features(self) -> List[Feature]:
        """Return persona-specific features"""
        
    def configure_ui(self, ui_manager: UIManager) -> None:
        """Configure persona-specific UI elements"""
        
    def get_analytics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return persona-specific analytics"""
```
