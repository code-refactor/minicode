# Unified Incremental Backup System - Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan to unify two persona-specific backup implementations (`creative_vault` and `gamevault`) around a shared `common` library. The goal is to eliminate code duplication while preserving all persona-specific functionality and ensuring all existing tests continue to pass.

## Current State Analysis

### Persona Implementations

#### Creative Vault (Digital Artist)
- **Target Users**: Digital artists, creative professionals
- **Core Features**: Visual diffs, timeline management, asset tracking, workspace capture, element extraction
- **Specializations**: Image/3D model processing, creative application integration, reference tracking
- **File Types**: PNG, JPG, OBJ, FBX, STL, Adobe project files
- **Key Components**: 6 specialized modules extending backup functionality

#### GameVault (Game Developer)  
- **Target Users**: Indie game developers
- **Core Features**: Asset optimization, playtest recording, feedback correlation, milestone management
- **Specializations**: Game asset chunking, cross-platform builds, performance optimization
- **File Types**: Game assets (textures, audio, models), build artifacts, project files
- **Key Components**: 5 modules focused on game development workflow

### Existing Common Library Assessment

The `common` library already provides a **robust foundation** with:

✅ **Complete Core Infrastructure**
- `UnifiedBackupEngine`: Production-ready backup system
- Content-addressed storage with deduplication
- Multiple chunking strategies (Fixed, Rolling Hash, Game Asset)
- Compression algorithms (zstd, zlib, bsdiff4 delta)
- Comprehensive configuration management
- Rich data models and exception handling

✅ **Architecture Excellence**
- Clean abstraction layers and plugin architecture
- Extensible design with clear integration points
- Factory patterns for strategy selection
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

# Before
from creative_vault.backup_engine import IncrementalBackup
from gamevault.backup_engine import BackupEngine

# After  
from common.core.backup_engine import UnifiedBackupEngine
from creative_vault.backup_engine import CreativeBackupEngine  # extends unified
from gamevault.backup_engine import GameBackupEngine  # extends unified
```

#### 3.2 Test Compatibility
- All existing tests must pass without modification
- Persona implementations maintain identical public APIs
- Performance meets or exceeds original implementations

        # Enhance with thumbnails, visual previews, etc.
        return snapshot
```

- Verify edge cases and error conditions

## Timeline and Dependencies

1. **Phase 1** (Common Library Enhancement): 2-3 hours

3. **Phase 3** (Integration & Testing): 1-2 hours
4. **Total Estimated Time**: 6-9 hours

The refactoring leverages the existing solid foundation in the common library, focusing on extending it with the missing framework components and then systematically migrating each persona to use the unified infrastructure while preserving all specialized functionality.
