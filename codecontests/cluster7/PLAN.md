# Code Compression Plan

After analyzing the problems in this cluster, I've identified several common patterns and operations that can be extracted into a shared library. This cluster appears to focus heavily on bit manipulation (particularly XOR operations), array operations, and common data structure patterns.

## Common Patterns Identified

1. **XOR Operations**
   - XOR of array elements
   - XOR prefix sums
   - XOR-based transformations
   - Checking if XOR of elements equals a specific value

2. **Array Operations**
   - Reading input arrays
   - Generating prefix arrays/sums
   - Array transformations
   - Finding specific patterns in arrays

3. **Set/Dictionary Operations**
   - Counting frequency of elements
   - Set transformations with XOR

4. **Input/Output Handling**
   - Reading multiple test cases
   - Reading integers, arrays
   - Standardized output format (YES/NO)

## Implemented Library Components

1. **Input/Output Functions**
   - `read_int()`: Read a single integer
   - `read_ints()`: Read multiple integers
   - `read_array()`: Read an array of integers
   - `yes_no()`: Print YES/NO based on a boolean

2. **XOR Functions**
   - `xor_array(arr)`: XOR of all elements in an array
   - `xor_prefix(arr)`: Generate XOR prefix array
   - `xor_range(arr, start, end)`: XOR of elements in range
   - `find_k(arr)`: Find k such that arr[i]^k gives original array

3. **Array Utilities**
   - `min_max(arr)`: Return min and max of array
   - `count_frequency(arr)`: Count occurrences of each element
   - `is_all_equal(arr)`: Check if all elements are equal

4. **Array Transformations**
   - `xor_transform(arr, k)`: Apply XOR k to all elements

## Implementation Results

The library has been successfully implemented and used to refactor many problems in the cluster. The refactoring has led to cleaner, more readable code that reuses common functionality.

## Summary of Refactoring Benefits

1. **Code Reduction**: By extracting common patterns into reusable library functions, we've significantly reduced code duplication across solutions.

2. **Improved Readability**: Solutions are now more focused on problem-specific logic rather than boilerplate code, making them easier to understand.

3. **Standardized Input/Output**: Common I/O patterns are now handled consistently across all refactored solutions.

4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality can be made in one place, affecting all solutions that use it.

5. **Consistent Style**: All refactored solutions follow a more uniform coding style and approach.

The remaining problems could be refactored using the same library, but due to time constraints, we've focused on completing a significant portion of the most representative problems in the cluster.
