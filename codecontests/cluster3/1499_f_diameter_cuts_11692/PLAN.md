# Code Compression Library Plan

Based on analysis of the provided problems, I've identified common patterns and components that can be extracted into a reusable library. The library will focus on providing utilities for solving graph and tree problems, which are the most common types in this collection.

## Library Components

### 1. Fast I/O Utilities
- FastIO class for efficient input/output operations
- Input parsing helpers

### 2. Graph/Tree Utilities
- Graph representation (adjacency list)
- Tree construction from input
- Common tree/graph traversal algorithms:
  - DFS (recursive and iterative)
  - BFS
  - Tree rooting

### 3. Tree-specific Operations
- Subtree size calculation
- Height/depth calculation
- LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
- Tree re-rooting
- Tree DP utilities

### 4. Data Structures
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
- Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree

### 5. Algorithm Helpers
- Topological sort
- Binary search utilities
- Dynamic programming helpers

## Implementation Approach

The library will be organized with clear function names and consistent interfaces. Functions will be designed to be composable and reusable across different problems.

For tree operations, we'll provide both generic implementations and specialized versions for common tasks.

## Refactoring Strategy

1. Start with implementing the core I/O and graph/tree utilities
2. Refactor problems that use similar patterns first to validate the library design
3. Incrementally add more specialized functions as needed
4. Test each refactored solution to ensure correctness

## Refactoring Checklist

This section will track which problems have been refactored and which remain to be done.
