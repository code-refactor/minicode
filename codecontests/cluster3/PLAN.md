# Library Design Plan for Cluster 3

## Overview
This cluster contains 30 tree-based competitive programming problems with common patterns around tree traversal, dynamic programming on trees, and tree manipulation. The library will provide reusable components to minimize code duplication.

## Key Patterns Identified

### 1. Tree Representation & I/O
- Standard input reading patterns
- Tree construction from edge lists
- 0-indexed vs 1-indexed conversion
- Parent-child relationships

### 2. Tree Traversal
- Iterative DFS with stack management
- Post-order processing for tree DP
- BFS for level-order operations
- Bootstrap pattern for deep recursion

### 3. Dynamic Programming on Trees
- Bottom-up DP computation
- Rerooting DP (change of root)
- State-based DP (include/exclude, multiple states)

### 4. Utility Functions
- Fast I/O handling
- Recursion limit management
- Common mathematical operations

## Library Structure

### Core Components

#### 1. TreeBuilder
```python
class TreeBuilder:
    @staticmethod
    def from_edges(n, edges, indexed=1, weighted=False)
    @staticmethod
    def from_parent_array(parents)
```

#### 2. TreeTraversal
```python
class TreeTraversal:
    @staticmethod
    def dfs_iterative(adj, root, parent=None)
    @staticmethod
    def postorder_stack(adj, root)
    @staticmethod
    def bfs_order(adj, root)
```

#### 3. TreeDP
```python
class TreeDP:
    @staticmethod
    def compute_subtree_dp(adj, root, dp_func)
    @staticmethod
    def rerooting_dp(adj, root, combine_func, change_func)
```

#### 4. Utilities
```python
class Utils:
    @staticmethod
    def fast_io()
    @staticmethod
    def bootstrap(func)
    @staticmethod
    def set_recursion_limit(limit=200000)
```

Total: 30/30 problems (100% completed)

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with core tree building utilities** - most problems need these
2. **Implement traversal patterns** - DFS and BFS utilities
3. **Add DP utilities** - bottom-up and rerooting patterns
4. **Refactor problems incrementally** - test each refactoring
5. **Optimize library** - remove unused functions, consolidate similar ones

## Success Metrics
- Reduce total lines of code across all solutions
- Maintain 100% test passing rate
- Maximize code reuse through library functions
- Improve code readability and maintainability
