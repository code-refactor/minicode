**COMPLETED: 21/30 problems (70%)**

## Summary

Successfully refactored 21 out of 30 problems in cluster4, achieving a 70% refactoring rate. The library provides significant code reduction and improved maintainability across these computational geometry problems.

### Key Library Functions Used:
- **Input/Output Functions**: `read_int()` (6 uses), `read_ints()` (14 uses) - Simplified input handling across 20 problems
- **Mathematical Functions**: `gcd()` (4 uses), `normalize_fraction()` (2 uses), `normalize_slope()` (2 uses) - Standardized mathematical operations
- **Geometric Functions**: `Vector2D` class (2 uses), `distance()` (2 uses), `dot_product()` (1 use), `float_equal()` (1 use), `cross_product()` (1 use), `is_collinear()` (1 use) - Unified geometric calculations

### Code Reduction Achieved:
- Replaced 60+ lines of GCD implementations with single library function calls
- Eliminated 40+ lines of vector operation code through Vector2D class
- Standardized input handling across 20 problems, reducing repetitive parsing code
- Replaced custom distance calculations with library distance functions
- Unified floating point comparisons with float_equal function

### Problems Successfully Refactored:
1. **Mathematical Functions** (6 problems): GCD operations, slope normalization, fraction normalization
2. **Input/Output Simplification** (20 problems): Cleaner input parsing with read_int/read_ints
3. **Geometric Operations** (6 problems): Vector operations, distance calculations, geometric predicates

### New Refactored Problems (Additional 3):
- **135_b_rectangle_and_square_9812**: Replaced sqrt distance calculations with library distance function
- **136_d_rectangle_and_square_9500**: Used dot_product, distance, and float_equal for geometric checks
- **13_b_letter_a_6066**: Replaced custom Vector2D class with library Vector2D class

### Challenges Encountered:
- Some problems had subtle dependencies on exact function behaviors (e.g., floating point precision)
- Complex custom classes in some problems made refactoring risky without extensive testing
- Output ordering sensitivity in some problems required careful preservation of original logic
- Several problems had precision formatting requirements that prevented successful refactoring
- 3D geometric problems (like cube restoration) couldn't use 2D library functions

The refactored solutions maintain 100% test pass rate while significantly reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with most commonly used functions (Vector2D, Line, GCD)
2. Refactor problems incrementally, testing each one
3. Add new library functions as patterns emerge
4. Optimize for code reduction while maintaining readability
5. Clean up unused functions at the end

## Success Metrics

- Reduce total lines of code across all solutions
- Maintain 100% test pass rate
- Maximize code reuse across problems
- Clean, readable library design
