# Library Design Plan

## Overview
Based on analysis of 30 competitive programming problems, the most common patterns are mathematical computations, especially modular arithmetic and combinatorics. The library will focus on these high-impact areas.

## Core Library Components

### 1. Modular Arithmetic (`mod_math`)
**Priority: HIGH** - Used in 25+ problems
- Fast modular exponentiation 
- Modular inverse (both prime and general modulus)
- Common modular constants (MOD = 10^9+7, etc.)

### 2. Combinatorics (`combinatorics`) 
**Priority: HIGH** - Used in 8+ problems
- Precomputed factorials with modular arithmetic
- Binomial coefficients (nCr) with multiple implementations
- Pascal's triangle utilities

### 3. Probability Utilities (`probability`)
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Used in 6+ problems  
- Expected value calculations
- Probability state transitions
- Fraction reduction for exact arithmetic

### 4. Fast I/O (`io_utils`)
**Priority: LOW** - Universal but simple
- Standardized input reading patterns
- Multiple test case handling

### 5. General Math (`math_utils`)
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Various usage
- GCD/LCM functions
- Fast exponentiation (non-modular)
- Prime utilities

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Math Functions
1. Create modular arithmetic class with fast power and inverse
2. Implement combinatorics with precomputed factorials
3. Add common constants and utilities

### Phase 2: Specialized Utilities  
1. Probability calculation helpers
2. Fraction simplification utilities
3. Common DP patterns

### Phase 3: Refactoring
1. Refactor each problem systematically
2. Test after each refactoring
3. Optimize library based on actual usage
