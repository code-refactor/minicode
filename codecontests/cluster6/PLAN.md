# Library Design Plan

Based on the analysis of the problems in this cluster, I've identified several common patterns and functionalities that can be extracted into a reusable library. This library will focus on mathematical operations, probability calculations, and dynamic programming utilities that are used across multiple problems.

## Common Patterns

1. **Math Operations**
   - Factorial calculations (often used in combinatorics problems)
   - Modular arithmetic (with common modulos like 10^9+7 or 998244353)
   - Combinations (nCr calculations)
   - GCD/LCM and fraction reduction

2. **Probability Calculations**
   - Expected value calculations
   - Probability state transitions
   - Dynamic programming with probability states

3. **Input Handling**
   - Fast input reading for various formats
   - Parsing different types of inputs

4. **Dynamic Programming Utilities**
   - Multi-dimensional DP table creation
   - Memoization helpers

## Library Structure

The library is organized with the following components:

### 1. Constants
```python
MOD1 = 10**9 + 7  # Common modulo used in many problems
MOD2 = 998244353  # Another common modulo
```

### 2. Math Operations
```python
def mod_add(a, b, mod=MOD1):
    """Add two numbers with modular arithmetic."""
    return (a + b) % mod

def mod_mul(a, b, mod=MOD1):
    """Multiply two numbers with modular arithmetic."""
    return (a * b) % mod

def mod_pow(base, exp, mod=MOD1):
    """Calculate (base^exp) % mod efficiently."""
    return pow(base, exp, mod)

def mod_inverse(x, mod=MOD1):
    """Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of x."""
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def factorial(n, mod=None):
    """Calculate n!."""
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
        if mod:
            result %= mod
    return result

def combination(n, k, mod=None):
    """Calculate nCk (n choose k)."""
    # Implementation with optimizations
    
def gcd(a, b):
    """Calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b."""
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    """Calculate the least common multiple of a and b."""
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def reduce_fraction(numerator, denominator):
    """Reduce a fraction to its simplest form."""
    g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
    return numerator // g, denominator // g
```

### 3. Probability & DP Utilities
```python
def expected_value(probabilities, values):
    """Calculate expected value from probabilities and values."""
    return sum(p * v for p, v in zip(probabilities, values))

def create_dp_table(dimensions, default_value=0):
    """Create a multi-dimensional DP table with given dimensions."""
    # Implementation for recursive creation of DP tables
```

### 4. Input/Output Utilities
```python
def fast_input():
    """Set up fast input reading."""
    return sys.stdin.readline

def read_int():
    """Read a single integer."""
    return int(input())

def read_ints():
    """Read a list of integers from a single line."""
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

def read_float():
    """Read a single float."""
    return float(input())

def read_floats():
    """Read a list of floats from a single line."""
    return list(map(float, input().split()))

def read_str():
    """Read a single string."""
    return input().strip()

def read_strs():
    """Read a list of strings from a single line."""
    return input().split()
```

### 5. Solution Template
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, mod=MOD1):
        self.mod = mod
        
    def read_input(self):
        """Override this method to read input for specific problem."""
        pass
        
    def solve(self):
        """Override this method to implement solution logic."""
        pass
        
    def run(self):
        """Run the solution."""
        self.read_input()
        result = self.solve()
        print(result)
```

## Refactoring Plan

I will approach the refactoring by:

1. First implementing the core library functions
2. Testing them with a few representative problems
3. Expanding the library as needed while refactoring all problems
4. Ensuring that all refactored solutions pass their tests

## Additional Notes and Improvements

After refactoring several problems, we've made significant progress in creating a reusable library for this cluster of problems. Here's what we've learned and observed:

1. **Common Mathematical Patterns**:
   - Fraction manipulation and reduction (in die_roll)
   - Combinatorial calculations (in advertising_agency)
   - Modular arithmetic (in slime_and_biscuits)
   - Probability calculations (in bag_of_mice, wizards_and_huge_prize, and random_events)

2. **Dynamic Programming Approaches**:
   - Multi-dimensional DP tables for state transitions (bag_of_mice, ilya_and_escalator)
   - DP for probability calculations (wizards_and_huge_prize)

3. **Implementation Challenges**:
   - Output formatting is critical, especially for floating-point results
   - The `Solution` class template is very useful for more complex problems
   - Fast input/output handling is important for performance

4. **Library Improvements**:
   - Added utility functions for creating DP tables
   - Implemented robust fraction operations
   - Provided efficient modular arithmetic operations
   - Created consistent input reading utilities

We've successfully refactored 7 problems so far (with one having partial test coverage), demonstrating the effectiveness of our library approach. Each refactored solution is more readable, maintainable, and clearly shows the core algorithm without being cluttered by utility functions.

As we continue to refactor more problems, we may identify additional common patterns that can be added to the library. We'll also focus on ensuring that all the solutions we've refactored have consistent interfaces and properly handle edge cases.
