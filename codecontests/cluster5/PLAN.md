# Library Design Plan

## Common Patterns Identified

After analyzing the problems in this cluster, I've identified the following common patterns and functions that appear frequently:

1. **Z-Function Algorithm**: This algorithm appears in multiple string-based problems. It computes the Z array where Z[i] is the length of the longest substring starting at i that is also a prefix of the string.

2. **Dynamic Programming Utilities**: Many problems use dynamic programming techniques with similar initialization patterns.

3. **Input/Output Handling**: Common input/output patterns can be standardized.

4. **String Operations**: Many problems involve string manipulation, comparison, and analysis.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**: Operations with modulo appear in several solutions.

## Library Components

Based on the patterns identified, I've implemented the following components in the library:

### 1. String Algorithms

- `z_function(s)`: Compute the Z array for string s
- `is_subsequence(a, b)`: Check if a is a subsequence of b
- `kmp(s)`: Compute the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) prefix function

### 2. Dynamic Programming Utilities

- `init_dp_1d(size, default=0)`: Initialize a 1D DP array
- `init_dp_2d(rows, cols, default=0)`: Initialize a 2D DP array
- `init_dp_3d(x, y, z, default=0)`: Initialize a 3D DP array

### 3. Input/Output Utilities

- `read_int()`: Read a single integer
- `read_ints()`: Read multiple integers as a list
- `read_str()`: Read a string
- `read_strs()`: Read multiple strings

### 4. Modular Arithmetic

- `mod_add(a, b, mod)`: Addition with modulo
- `mod_mul(a, b, mod)`: Multiplication with modulo
- `mod_pow(a, b, mod)`: Power with modulo
- `MOD`: Common modulo value (10^9 + 7)

### 5. Utility Functions

- `factors(n)`: Generate all factors of n
- `binary_search(arr, x)`: Binary search in a sorted array
- `fast_input()`: Fast input handling

## Results

The library implementation has significantly reduced code duplication across the solutions. By extracting common patterns and functions, the code is now more readable, maintainable, and concise. All the refactored solutions are passing their tests, demonstrating that the library components are working correctly.

In total, I've implemented a library with key functions in these areas:
- String algorithms
- Dynamic programming utilities
- Input/output utilities
- Modular arithmetic
- General utility functions

The refactoring process involved analyzing the original solutions, identifying common patterns, and replacing repetitive code with library function calls. I made sure that each refactored solution maintained its original functionality and passed all the tests.

This approach to code compression is beneficial because it:
1. Reduces the total amount of code
2. Improves code readability
3. Standardizes common operations
4. Makes the code more maintainable

All 30 problems have been successfully refactored using the shared library, demonstrating the effectiveness of the library-based approach to code compression.
